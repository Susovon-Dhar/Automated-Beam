# Automated-Beam
The Python script initializes a connection to AutoCAD using pyautocad, allowing drawing commands to be sent directly. It calculates clear cover, beam depth, and span parameters, adds annotations, and dimension lines. It also draws stirrups, taking parameters for beam depth, span, &amp; no of stirrups. The script collects user input for beam parameters.
